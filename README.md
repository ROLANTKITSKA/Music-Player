# Music-Player!
This is a fully functional music player application using C# and Windows Forms, featuring a user-friendly interface for managing and playing audio tracks.

Integrated a SQLite database to store and manage track metadata, including artist name, release date, genre, language, file path, and album art, ensuring persistent storage and retrieval of music data.

Implemented CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for managing tracks, allowing users to add, update, delete, and view song details seamlessly.

Designed a dynamic playlist system using a List<Songs> to track user interactions, enabling the application to display and sort tracks based on user preferences and play counts.

Implemented a random track selection feature, allowing users to shuffle and play songs from their library with a single click.
